# Svelte Routify 3 (beta) page transition app

This app is based on [sveltekit-shared-element-transitions](https://github.com/geoffrich/sveltekit-shared-element-transitions) ported to Svelte with [Routify 3](https://v3.routify.dev/)

This app is still a Work In Progress (WIP) and is a result of discussion on [svelte-ionic-app](https://github.com/Tommertom/svelte-ionic-app/issues/32) for how to make native mobile page transitions for Ionic with Svelte.
